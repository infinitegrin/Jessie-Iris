jeez. the first site i coded. really difficult, but thank you to stackoverflow for guiding me through this tumultuous time.


Now--

Main goal of this site was to be a hub for "Jessie"'s social media, a tour list, and a highlight of his recent video/proj. 

Client's words, not mine.

BUT i still would have worded it that way. 


The initial plot of the user journey required unique visitors to end up at his music in some way shape or form. The only way to avoid it would be to
press back out of the site.

For fans, they would simply divert their attention to the tour list, listed at the bottom. This would not be without
passing through the video, and being followed by a "music" icon that links back to his music. That way, even fans would
still be inclined to go back to the music.

Part of me says:
  "that's a bad move, because you're inhibiting the user from exploring the site easily"
 
I respond:
  "This is my first website. Also it truly isn't a large site, scrolling up for a single second is right where you began"
  
All places link to Jessie's social platforms (which are saturated with links to spotify)

As of right now, he holds no external representation and is limited to gigs in the local area he's in, so a contact form
  is unnecessary (that being said I know how to do it!!!!!! lay off my back man :// ). Many of his gigs are made either
  through instagram/fb DMs, and through college-sponsored events. 
  
FAQ:

"Why is there no favicon?"
  I didn't ask yet (as of Sept. 30th, 2018... will update when he sent one over)
  
"how much did you get paid?"
  nothing. I would be a huge jerk if I asked for any type of money.

"Are you a fan of his music?"
  sure
  
that concludes this readme. for now
